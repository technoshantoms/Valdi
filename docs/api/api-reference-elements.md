## Layout

**JSX Element:** `<layout>`

Represents a node in the layout tree. Use a `<layout>` instead of `<view>` whenever possible, since these nodes will not be backed by a platform view when rendering, making them more performant.

### Properties

#### Layout Attributes

##### Lifecycle Callbacks

**`onLayout`**: `(frame: ElementFrame) => void`
- Called whenever the calculated frame for the element has changed.

**`onVisibilityChanged`**: `(isVisible: boolean, eventTime: EventTime) => void`
- Called whenever the visibility for the element has changed.

**`onViewportChanged`**: `(viewport: ElementFrame, frame: ElementFrame, eventTime: EventTime) => void`
- Called whenever the calculated viewport for the element has changed.
- The viewport represents the rectangle area within the element's frame that is visible.

**`onLayoutComplete`**: `() => void`
- Called after a layout pass has completed, if this node or any of its children were updated.

**`onMeasure`**: `OnMeasureFunc`
- If set, the node will be set as a lazyLayout, and the given measure callback will be called whenever the node needs to be measured.
- The callback should return a MeasuredSize tuple representing how big the node should be.
- Type: `(width: number, widthMode: MeasureMode, height: number, heightMode: MeasureMode) => MeasuredSize`

##### Performance Optimization

**`lazyLayout`**: `boolean`
- Whether the layout starting from this element should be lazy.
- A lazy layout is disconnected from its parent layout; its children cannot impact the layout of the parent.
- Setting this to true will defer layout calculation for all the children until this layout is determined to be visible.
- This can help with performance when the layout is within a ScrollView.
- Default: `false`

**`limitToViewport`**: `boolean`
- Whether the backing native View instance should only be created if the element is visible within the viewport.
- Setting this to true can help with performance when the view is within a ScrollView.
- Default: `true`

**`lazy`**: `boolean`
- Shorthand for lazyComponent, lazyLayout and limitToViewport.
- Default: `false`

**`estimatedWidth`**: `number`
- If set, the node will use this value as the base width that the node should measure at before the children are inserted.
- This is typically used on nodes that represent an empty placeholder that are later rendered with children.

**`estimatedHeight`**: `number`
- If set, the node will use this value as the base height that the node should measure at before the children are inserted.

##### Identity & References

**`id`**: `string`
- Used to uniquely identify an element in the global valdi context.

**`key`**: `string`
- A key to uniquely identify the element.
- If it is not provided, the framework will generate one based on the index in which the element is being rendered.

**`ref`**: `IRenderedElementHolder<this>`
- Sets an element reference holder, which will keep track of the rendered elements.

##### Visual Properties

**`animationsEnabled`**: `boolean`
- Can be used to disable animations for this element and its children.
- Default: `true`

**`zIndex`**: `number`
- Loosely, zIndex specifies the order in which siblings are layered on top of each other.
- Higher zIndex will mean that an element will be rendered "on top" of its siblings.
- Specifying a zIndex will make the framework sort this element and its siblings before rendering the view tree.

**`class`**: `string`
- Sets a CSS class to use from the associated CSS document.
- You typically would use the style property directly instead.

**`ignoreParentViewport`**: `boolean`
- Whether the calculated viewport for this element should not be intersected with the viewport of the parent.
- This allows a child to have a viewport bigger than its parent.

#### Size Properties

**`width`**: `CSSValue` (string | number)
- Specifies the width of an element's content area.
- `auto` (default): width for the element based on its content.
- points: Defines the width in absolute points.

**`aspectRatio`**: `number`
- Specifies the aspect ratio of an element's content area.
- Defined as the ratio between the width and the height of a node.
- e.g. if a node has an aspect ratio of 2 then its width is twice the size of its height.

#### Position Properties

**`position`**: `'relative' | 'absolute'`
- The position type of an element defines how it is positioned within its parent.
- `relative` (default): positioned according to the normal flow of the layout, then offset relative to that position based on the values of top, right, bottom, and left.

A view for displaying text.

### Properties

All properties from [Layout Attributes](#layout), plus:

#### Text Content

**`value`**: `string | AttributedText`
- The text value of the label.
- Use the `AttributedTextBuilder` class to set a value composed of multiple strings with different text attributes.

#### Text Styling

**`font`**: `string`
- Set the font used to render the text characters.
- This attribute must be a string with 4 parts separated by space:
  1. required: the name of the font (including the font's weight)
  2. required: the size of the font
  3. optional: the scaling type (or 'unscaled' for no scaling)
  4. optional: the maximum size of the font after scaling
- Example: `'AvenirNext-Bold 16 unscaled 16'`
- Default: `'system 12'`

**`color`**: `Color`
- Set the rendering color for the text characters.
- Default: `black`

**`textGradient`**: `string`
- Set the Gradient color for the text string. Overrides color setting.
- Use `"linear-gradient(color1, color2, color3...)"` for evenly-spaced stops.
- Use `"linear-gradient(color1 stop1, color2 stop2, color3 stop3...)"` for custom stops.

**`textShadow`**: `string`
- Add a shadow to the text.
- Syntax: `'{color} {radius} {opacity} {offsetX} {offsetY}'`
- All number values are interpreted as points.
- Note: TextShadow and BoxShadow are mutually exclusive.
- Example: `'rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.1) 1 1 1 1'`

#### Text Layout

**`numberOfLines`**: `number`
- This property controls the maximum number of lines to use to fit the label's text into its bounding rectangle.
- To remove any maximum limit, and use as many lines as needed, set the value to 0.
- Default: `1`

**`textAlign`**: `'left' | 'right' | 'center' | 'justified'`
- Set the horizontal alignment behavior for the label's text.
- Note: it will automatically invert in RTL locales:
  - In RTL locales, "left" will align text to the right of the label's bounds
  - In RTL locales, "right" will align text to the left of the label's bounds
- Default: `'left'`

**`textDecoration`**: `'none' | 'strikethrough' | 'underline'`
- Optionally adds a visual decoration effect to the label's text.
- Default: `undefined`

**`lineHeight`**: `number`
- Rendering size of each line of the label, this value is a ratio of the font height.
- If the lineHeight ratio is above 1, spacing is added on top of each line of the text.
- Example: A value of 2 will double the height of each line.
- Default: `1`

**`letterSpacing`**: `number`
- Extra spacing added at the end of each character, in points.
- Note: negative values will shrink the space between characters.
- Default: `0`

**`textOverflow`**: `'ellipsis' | 'clip'`
- Controls how hidden text overflow content is signaled to users.
- Default: `'ellipsis'`

#### Auto-sizing

**`adjustsFontSizeToFitWidth`**: `boolean`
- If this property is `true`, and the text exceeds the label's bounding rectangle, the label reduces the font size until the text fits or it has scaled down to the minimum font size.
- If you set this to `true`, be sure to also set an appropriate minimum font scale with `minimumScaleFactor`.
- Notes:
  - This autoshrinking behavior is mostly intended for use with a single-line label when numberOfLines == 1.
  - This will also work when for multiline using numberOfLines > 0 but the behavior will be much less predictable.
  - Specifying the label's width/height/minHeight will make the auto-shrink behavior much more predictable.
- Default: `false`

**`minimumScaleFactor`**: `number`
- If `adjustsFontSizeToFitWidth` is `true`, use this property to specify the smallest multiplier for the current font size that yields an acceptable font size for the label's text.
- Default: `0`

#### View Properties

All view properties from [View](#view).

#### Styling

**`style`**: `IStyle<Label | View | Layout>`
