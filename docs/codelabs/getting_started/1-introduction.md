# Getting started with Valdi from scratch

## What is Valdi?

Valdi is a framework that allows you to build performant, cross platform, declarative UI in TypeScript.

The Valdi hotreloader lets you iterate quickly by live updating the UI on a connected device or emulator while you're developing.

You can easily hook into native code.

## What Valdi is not

Valdi is not TypeScript rendered in a WebView.

The Valdi compiler takes TypeScript source and compiles it down to **valdimodule** files that are read by the Valdi runtime to render natively on each platform.

## Why use Valdi?

Once you're ramped up, Valdi development is faster than native; you can write UI and business logic once and use it on multiple platforms and the hotreloader lets you iterate faster during development.

We handle performance optimization for you so you don't need to understand the nuances of each platform's UI to create a good user experience.

# What is this code lab?

This is your Valdi starting point. If you've never worked with Valdi before and you want to, you're in the right place.

In this code lab, we will walk you through getting the code, configuring your development environment, and the basics of building a Valdi UI.

## Prerequisites

You should already be familiar with your native platform of choice. That means you can build and install either an Android or iOS app and have a basic understanding of how their respective development environments work.

Follow the instructions in [INSTALL.md](../../INSTALL.md) to get your machine prepared for building apps with Valdi.
