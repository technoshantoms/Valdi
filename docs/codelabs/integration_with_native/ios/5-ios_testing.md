# Testing
Remember when we added all of those ids? It's time to put them to use. 

On iOS, Valdi renders UI as native Views so we can work with them the same way you'd work with pure native UI with one big caveat: Valdi is its own special rendering engine. We need the whole runtime for tests so we'll be creating UI tests.

**TODO**: Unit Tests with publicly available iOS testing environments
