# What is this codelab?
In this code lab, you will learn how to use Valdi to communicate with native and native to communicate with Valdi.

Before diving in, you should be comfortable building your platform of choice and have a basic understanding of how to build a Valdi UI. If you're not there yet, check out the [**Getting Started Codelab**](../getting_started/1-introduction.md).

<!-- TODO: will there be any pre-work style documentation for the public? -->
This code lab starts by building a common UI and then splits off in to **Android** and **iOS** specific paths. We recommend going all the way through one platform first and then coming back for the other.

# Pre-work
Let's make sure you're setup to develop.

In the [**Getting Started Codelab**](../getting_started) you were only modifying typescript which meant that the hotreloader could do all of the work of updating the UI. 

In this codelab, we're going to be modifying native interfaces which means that we need a module linked build.

TODO: workflow-overview is in Snapchat/Valdi

You can find the [full documentation](../workflow-overview#iterating-locally) on the Valdi docs site but we'll walk you through it here. -->

**TODO**: Publicly available documentation. This described building the private apps from source.
