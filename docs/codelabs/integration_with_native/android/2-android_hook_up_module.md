# Hook up the module
Now that we have the module bundled up and the code in the right place, we can actually hook up our UI.

**TODO**: Example using publicly available source code

If you are having trouble with the imports, they were specified in the @GenerateNativeClass annotation during a [previous step](./6-native_build_module.md). If you're working with Android studio, it may not pick up the newly generated files, run a Bazel sync to pick up the new changes.

Rebuild and install the Android app. Navigate to the playground and load up your new UI.
